"Accessory-tooth--movable-finger-","1. No accessory tooth. 2. Single accessory tooth present. This is found commonly in species from the Old World. 3. Three accessory teeth present. Rare condition. 4. Five accessory teeth. Very rare. Occasionally species with 2,4 or more than 5 accessory teeth may occur."
"Anterodorsal-margin--leg-IV-","1. 90° angle. This is the most common condition. 2. Less than 90° angle (rare). 3. More than 90° angle (rare)."
"Apical-process--trochanter-","1. Apical process well-rounded. 2. Apical process slightly produced in a weak tip. (most common condition). 3. Apical process very prominent, might be digitiform. The condition of the apical process might vary depending on dimorphism of the pedipalps."
"Dimorphism","Dimorphism in pedipalps is common in the order and can be of varying degree. 1. Normal (or homeomorph) pedipalps. This is a common condition. Species with this character show little difference in pedipalp morphology for males and females. 2. Mesomorph pedipalps. 3. Heteromorph pedipalps. This is a common condition for species from the New World, especially of the Caribbean. In species with strong pedipalpal dimorphism all of the displayed conditions can be present in the same species."
"Dorsal-setation","There is a certain degree of plasticity in this character. Additional single or paired setae may occur as well as one of the pairs might be absent. It is also not rare for species to lose some of their setae. 1. Only one pair of setae present (rare). 2. Two pairs of setae present (common). 3. Three pairs of setae present (majority of species). 4. Four pairs of setae present (less common). 5. Five pairs of setae present (rare). 6. Exotic patterns such as 2:2:1:2, 2:1:2, 1:2:2 or others (all very rare)."
"Elongation","1. No elongation of opisthosoma (majority of species). 2. Extreme elongation of segment IX. This particular condition is found in a single species from Singapore (Bucinozomus hortuspalmarum). 3. Elongation of segments V/VI-XII. This is a rare condition and is found only in species from the New World."
"Flagellum-dorsal-shape--male-","1. Oblong. 2. Circular. 3. Trigonal. 4. Rectangular. 5. Rhomboidal. 6. Trilobate. 7. Lanceolate. 8. Trapezoidal. 9. Polygonal. 10. Arrow-shaped. In this data base, combinations of two of these shapes are frequently used to describe the flagellum shape more precisely."
"Guard-tooth--movable-finger-","Guard tooth shown in red. 1. Guard tooth present (most species). 2. Absent (in Protoschizomidae)."
"Mesal-spur--trochanter-","1. Without mesal spur. This condition occurs in Protoschizomidae and less commonly in Hubbardiidae, especially in Australian genera."
"Number-of-flagellomeres--female-","1. Two flagellomeres (very rare). 2. Three flagellomeres. This is the common condition for species from the Old World. 3. Four flagellomeres. This is the common condition for species from the New World. 4. Five flagellomeres. This is the common condition for Protoschizomidae. 5. Six flagellomeres (only in Megaschizominae)."
"Number-of-lobes","This is a very important and stable character for genus level identification. 1. Single pair of lobes present. This condition is found in all Protoschizomidae. It is also common in South American species. 2. Two pairs of lobes present (majority of species). 3. More than five pairs of lobes present (rare). Three or four pairs of lobes may also occur."
"Setation","1. 1+1 pattern. This is found in most species from the New World. 2. 1+2 pattern. This is a rare pattern only found in a few species from the Old World. 3. 2+1 pattern. This is found in most species from the Old World."
"Setation--base-","1. Without setation (all Hubbardiinae); 2. Single seta present (only in Cretaceous species); 3. Pair of setae present (in Protoschizomidae and Megaschizominae)"
"Setation--tergite-II-","1. Single pair of setae present. This condition is most common. 2. Three setae present. This is a common condition for Caribbean and Australian species. 3. Four (or up to seven) setae. This condition is only being found in some Caribbean species."
"Sex","The flagellum (tail) is the best character to distinguish between male and female specimens. 1. Male flagellum. Most species have the flagellum horizontally flattened, a range of shapes can occur, including circular, arrow-shaped, lanceolate, etc. 2. Female flagellum. Always plain and digitiform, consisting of two to six pseudosegments (flagellomeres). Juvenile specimens of both sexes have undifferentiated flagella that resemble those of adult females."
"Small-teeth--fixed-finger-","1. No small teeth (only in Protoschizomidae). 2. Single small tooth present (only in Megaschizominae). 3. Three small teeth present (common). Five small teeth present (common). Two, four or more than five (up to eight) teeth can be present."
"State-of-gonopod","1. Without gonopod. This condition is rather being found in species from the New World. 2. Gonopod present (common in Old World species)."
"State-of-metapeltidium","1. Metapeltidium entire. This condition is found in most species of the New World. 2. Metapeltidium with suture. This means that it is not distinctly separated in two parts but the median line of the metapeltidium is visibly thinner and slight translucent. It is a rare condition. 3. Divided metapeltidium. This is the common condition for species from the Old World. This character is slightly plastic and species with both, divided and entire metapeltidium are known."
"State-of-vision","1. Without eyespots or eyes. This is a common condition for species adapted to live in dark environments such as caves. 2. Eyespots present. This is the most common condition. Eyespots are no proper eyes but rather light-sensitive regions on the propeltidium. 3. Corneate (true) eyes. Only four living species retained this condition. It is more commonly found within fossil schizomids from the Cretaceous."
"Tergite-XII--posterodorsal-process","1. Without posterodorsal process. This condition is present in almost all females. 2. Small posterodorsal process present (common). 3. Well-developed posterodorsal process (common)."
"Tergite-XII--posterodorsal-process--shape-","1. Round 2. Acute 3. Conical 4. Truncate 5. Paired (only in species of Surazomus)"
